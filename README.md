# ML-project
ML project based on weather prediction model
The database used is of manhattan from 1996 onwards.
Tried finding data of cities around me but 2-3 factors were only recorded and the US weather data had many more factors that could affect prediciton.
This model has a little error in prediction.
Still trying to make my model more accurate.
